# Weak-encryption

## Description: 

An encryption program implemented in Python that loads an image and then using bitwise
operations such as AND, OR and XOR encrypts it. I showed why, in cryptography, encryption using
bitwise operations is ineffective except for XOR operations under the right assumptions.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

## Installation and Usage:
- Clone this repository in the terminal (or command prompt)
```shell
   git clone https://github.com/WojciechSkumajTo/Weak-encryption.git
```
- Run the Python 3 code in the terminal (or command prompt):
```shell
  sudo python3 noise.py
```
## Result
